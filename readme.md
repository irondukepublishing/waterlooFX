This is a JavaFX-based scientific charting library for Java 8+


**Files**

**waterlooFX.jar**
    The core library is available as waterlooFX.jar.

*This is the file needed by Java developers and can be imported into Oracle's Scene Builder 2.*

*NB The "stand-alone" copy of waterlooFX.jar will be updated more often in the pre-release phase than the copy bundled in the demos so should be preferred by developers.
For the latest code, use the git repo.*


**waterlooFXDemo.jar**
    This includes waterlooFX.jar in the /lib folder and is a FXML-based demo of the waterlooFX code.
    It is a self-executing jar that requires an existing Java 8.

**waterlooFXDemo.msi and waterlooFXDemo.dmg**
    These are Windows and Mac installers for the demo that have an embedded copy of the Java 8 JRE.

*Windows users: the installer places an icon on the desktop - click that to run it.*
