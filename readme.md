This is a JavaFX-based scientific charting library for Java 8+.

It has now been configured for Maven and the Git repo has the pom files etc included.


**Files**

**waterlooFX-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar**
    The core library is available as waterlooFX.jar (or waterlooFX-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar when built with Maven).

*This is the file needed by Java developers and can be imported into Oracle's Scene Builder 2.*

*NB The "stand-alone" copy of the jar will be updated more often in the pre-release phase than the copy bundled in the demos so should be preferred by developers.
For the latest code, use the git repo.*

**waterlooFX.jar is obsolete with the conversion to Maven**


**waterlooFXDemo.zip** waterlooFXDemo.jar is a self-executing jar that requires an existing Java 8 installation.It runs an FXML-based demo of the waterlooFX code.
The zip includes waterlooFX-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar in the /lib folder.
    

**waterlooFXDemo_Windows__64_bit.msi and waterlooFXDemo.dmg**
    These are Windows 64 and Mac installers for the demo that have an embedded copy of the Java 8 JRE.

*Windows users: the installer places an icon on the desktop - click that to run it.*
